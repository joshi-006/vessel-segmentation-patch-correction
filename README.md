Vessel Segmentation with Uncertainty-Guided Patch Correction

📌 Overview

This project improves retinal vessel segmentation by applying a post-processing patch correction pipeline on top of a trained segmentation model.

Instead of modifying the segmentation model itself, the method focuses on correcting uncertain regions using uncertainty estimation and a safety-based update rule.

🧠 Method

🔹 Base Model

- FR-UNet ensemble (trained on FIVES dataset)

🔹 Key Components

- MC Dropout → generates multiple predictions
- Mutual Information (MI) → identifies uncertain regions
- Patch Extraction → selects high-uncertainty patches
- Patch Correction Model (Attention U-Net)
- Safe Update Rule → applies correction only if it improves confidence and reduces uncertainty

---

🚀 Key Idea

«Instead of correcting all regions, we selectively correct only uncertain patches, and apply a guarded update mechanism to avoid degrading already correct predictions.»

▶️ How to Run

1. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Download Dataset

This project uses the FIVES dataset from Kaggle:

👉 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikitamanaenkov/fundus-image-dataset-for-vessel-segmentation

After downloading, place it in:

data/
└── fundus-image-dataset-for-vessel-segmentation/

---

3. Download Model Weights

Pretrained FR-UNet ensemble weights are not included due to size constraints.

👉 "Download Weights" (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HT6GWupH946phBKnBLplz5KhaKGiAr_B/view?usp=sharing)

After downloading, place the pretrained weights in the following directory:

```id="o5p4sp"
models_weights/
├── FRUNet_MC_0.pth
├── FRUNet_MC_1.pth
├── FRUNet_MC_2.pth
├── FRUNet_MC_3.pth
└── FRUNet_MC_4.pth
```

These files correspond to multiple trained instances of the FR-UNet model used for inference and patch-level correction.
