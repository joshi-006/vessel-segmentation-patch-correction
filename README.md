Vessel Segmentation with Uncertainty-Guided Patch Correction

📌 Overview

This project improves retinal vessel segmentation by applying a post-processing patch correction pipeline on top of a trained segmentation model.

Instead of modifying the segmentation model itself, the method focuses on correcting uncertain regions using uncertainty estimation and a safety-based update rule.

🧠 Method

🔹 Base Model

- FR-UNet ensemble (trained on FIVES dataset)

🔹 Key Components

- MC Dropout → generates multiple predictions
- Mutual Information (MI) → identifies uncertain regions
- Patch Extraction → selects high-uncertainty patches
- Patch Correction Model (Attention U-Net)
- Safe Update Rule → applies correction only if it improves confidence and reduces uncertainty

---

🚀 Key Idea

«Instead of correcting all regions, we selectively correct only uncertain patches, and apply a guarded update mechanism to avoid degrading already correct predictions.»
